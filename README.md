#SudokuSolver
##-because I'm bored...
...so after I solved a Sudoku, I wanted to try solving it using Java.
So far I've implemented some simple logic for solving by checking rows, columns and blocks.
It isn't able to solve the sample Sudoku by itself yet.
Though, by filling out just three fields for it, (5,5,), (9,9) and (8,2), it can solve the rest by itself.
I might implement some more complex methods for solving another time when I get bored. :-)
